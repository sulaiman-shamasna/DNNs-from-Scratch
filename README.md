# DNNs-from-Scratch
---
This project aims at implementing deep neural networks from scatch without using frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch as a first step to understand neural networks architectures! This implementation, however, based on the course [Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCFToE1vM2U&list=PLpOGQvPCDQzvJEPFUQ3mJz72GJ95jyZTh) given by Prof. Andreas Mair at [FAU-Erlangen NÃ¼rnberg from the Computer Science Department - Pattern Recognition lab](https://lme.tf.fau.de/).

## Structure
This project comprises four main parts built on top of one another. The last part, however, represents a project of image classification task.
